Nyxus is a feature-rich, highly optimized, Python/C++ application capable of analyzing images of arbitrary size 
and assembling complex regions of interest (ROIs) split across multiple image tiles and files. This accomplished through 
multi-threaded tile prefetching and a three phase analysis pipeline shown below.
